== 🎮 Game Overview

"Memory Maze" is a narrative-rich, console-based simulation inspired by real events. The game blends item-based exploration with abstract storytelling inside the symbolic “mind maze” of an unnamed character.

The player must navigate a series of metaphorical rooms, collecting “Truth Fragments” that represent critical elements of identity: trauma, community, faith, addiction, and legacy.

== 🧠 Objective

Collect all 5 Truth Fragments and return them to the Conscience Room before being consumed by urself (the game's time-based failure state).

* Win Condition: All 5 fragments are collected and placed in the final room.
* Lose Condition: 40 turns pass before the fragments are returned.

== 🧱 Core Gameplay Structure

=== World Design

Rooms are metaphorical spaces based on real places:

- The Liquor Store
- The Trap House
- The Church
- The Child's Room
- The Conscience Room (Final deposit room)

=== Items

Items are narrative-rich collectibles tied to a theme:

[cols="2,1"]
|===
| Name                        | Theme
| Grandma's Tape Recorder     | Family / grounding voice
| Blood-Stained T-Shirt       | Violence / survivor's guilt
| Bible with Notes            | Faith / self-reflection
| Polaroid                    | Memory / community
|===

=== Game States

* `Playing`: Game is active.
* `Enlightened`: All fragments collected and returned.
* `Consumed`: Player ran out of time.

== ⚙️ Technical Breakdown

=== Object-Oriented Design

The game uses OOP principles:
- **Inheritance**: Item base class → TruthFragment, KeyItem, FlashbackToken
- **Encapsulation**: Private state with public methods (e.g., `Inventory.AddItem()`)
- **Polymorphism**: Different item types with custom behavior (`Use()` method)

=== Game Loop

- Accept player input (move, take, use)
- Update turn counter
- Trigger narrative events
- Check win/lose conditions

== 💬 Creative Features

* **Narrative Echoes**: Collecting fragments triggers a ghostly voice or fragment
* **Locked Rooms**: Some rooms are inaccessible without specific truths
* **Flashbacks**: Optional items show past trauma or turning points
* **Conscience Room**: Ending is a reflective message summarizing the choices made

== 🎨 Sample Narrative Snippet

_You pick up the Polaroid. A grainy smile stares back at you. The ghost whispers:_  
*"This is where you started. Don't forget who you were."*

== 📦 Future Enhancements (Optional)

- NPC ghosts that speak lyrics when given certain items
- A visual minimap (ASCII art)
- Alternate endings depending on item order
- Randomized relic placement per playthrough
